# Smart-Accident-and-Intruson-Detection-System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **dual ESP8266–based smart vehicle safety system** that combines:

- Accident Detection & Alerting  
- Intrusion Detection & Prevention (IDPS)  
- Spoofed CAN Message Simulation  
- Real-time GPS Location Tracking  
- Email Alert System  

The system uses **two ESP8266 nodes**:
- **ESP1 (Defender / IDPS Node)** – Detects spoofed CAN messages and triggers alerts  
- **ESP2 (Vehicle / Attacker Simulation Node)** – Detects accidents, sends alerts, and simulates spoofed CAN packets

## ⚙️ System Working

### 🔹 ESP2 – Accident Detection & Spoofing Node
- Reads acceleration data from **MPU6050**
- Detects accidents using a **G-force threshold**
- Determines **impact direction**
- Fetches **GPS coordinates**
- Sends an **email alert** with accident & location details
- Periodically sends **spoofed CAN messages via UDP** to ESP1

### 🔹 ESP1 – Intrusion Detection (IDPS) Node
- Acts as a **UDP server**
- Listens for incoming CAN packets
- Detects **spoofed messages**
- Logs **attacker IP address**
- Triggers:
  - LED alert  
  - Buzzer warning  
- Simulates **blocking the attacker**
